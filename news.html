        &nbsp;The Coronavirus Lockdown 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">
    &nbsp;A lockdown has been announced in many countries around the &nbsp;world becouse of ongoing problems surrounding coronaviris
    <br>&nbsp;This is leaving many people with no choice but to conduct their &nbsp;business from home. Naturally, people should have a
    <br>&nbsp;plan in place and some strategies to ensure that they will be able to make the most if this temporary containment 
    <br>
    <br>&nbsp;Success will always come to those who are hard-working, &nbsp;dedicated, commited, and persistent. They are the ones who were
    <br>&nbsp;taking action instead of sitting around and talking endlessly about a wide range of unimportant staff, which is never going
    <br>&nbsp;to provide them with measurable results
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph1">
        &nbsp;Managing your body
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">
    &nbsp;The fact that you work from home these days does not mean that &nbsp;you can relax your exercising routine.
    <br>&nbsp;It also does not mean that it is no longer necessary to look at your physical health.Instead, now can be the
    <br>&nbsp;perfect time to set new standards and to program them into your consciousness to such an extent thhat they will
    <br>&nbsp;become a way of living long after work from home period has ceased. There is a whole lot of exercises which can
    <br>&nbsp;be done without the need to have specialized equipment.
    <br>
    <br>&nbsp;A lot can be accomplished simply by using the doing exercise at home, and therefore is no need to lower your standards as
    <br>&nbsp;far as exercising is concerned.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph1">
        &nbsp;Have Firm Office Hours 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">
    &nbsp;Just because you have been forced to work from home does not mean that you can justify altering your schedule. 
    <br>&nbsp; It's important to stay in routine and to ensure that everething remains as normal and organized as it always has been.
    <br>&nbsp; This will also make it easier to get up to speed once the locdown has been canceled.
